<h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p> The purpose of this app is to reduce food waste by connecting those with excess food to those in need.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
    <p> Our app uses the following features to provide an excellent experience to our nonexistent customers. 
        We use multiple screens, a menu, a firebase firestore, camera, GPS, google maps, and fragments.</p>

        but also for charities and other organizations to coordinate food rescues.

<h2>App Evolution</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Checkpoint 1 <p>Our primary focus for checkpoint 1 was to set up our development environment, mainly our database solution, 
        and to develop our method of contribution. The end result is a basic login and registration activity 
        that connects to firebase for authentication.</p></li>

        that connects to firebase for authentication.</p></li>
    <li>Checkpoint 2 <p>The next stage was to add functionality to the application in the form of a listing creation page and an organization registration page.
         This stage also dealt with asking for camera permissions and taking photos.</p></li>
    <li>Checkpoint 3 <p>In checkpoint 3 we integrated location services as well as google maps using fragments, 
        now we have our main activity. The only thing missing is our database connection.</p></li>
    <li>Checkpoint 4 <p>Success!  We now have a map that displays the location of items in relation to the user. Our page also allows a user to filter and examine listings. 
        Organizations can now edit and modify listings that they created.</p></li>
    <li>Checkpoint 5 <p>Checkpoint 5 is all about polishing existing features, this involved a custom icon and 
        theme aswell as giving organizations more control over their content. </p></li>
